# VisitorQuery WHMCS addon

An add-on for  [WHMCS](https://whmcs.com) providing integration with
[VisitorQuery](https://visitorquery.com/)

VisitorQuery stops fraud and slashes chargebacks by detecting proxy and VPN
users in real time. Unlike traditional solutions, we donâ€™t use IP checks or
blacklists. Our AI and deep packet inspection technology catches all proxy
types, including residential ones.
